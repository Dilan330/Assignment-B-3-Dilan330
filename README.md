# STAT 545 - Assignment 3B and 4C - R Built-in Data Sets

## Assignment 3B 
This is a repository for STAT 545 - Assignment 3B - Option B. It contains the app: R Built-in Data Sets, which can be accessed with this *link*: https://dilan330.shinyapps.io/assignment-b-3-dilan330/
This app was built from the code in `App.R`.  

### App Description 
This app offers quick and accessible information about some of the built-in data sets in R. The data sets are: `mtcars`, `iris`, `ToothGrowth`, `PlantGrowth`,`USArrests`. 
This app allows you to select the desired data set (*Feature 1*) and displays a table of the corresponding data set and a summary table (*Feature 3*). There is also the freedom to select the number of observations displayed in the table (*Feature 2*). 
All data sets used for this app are sourced within R, they are built in data sets. 

## Assignment 4C 
This is also a repository for STAT 545 - Assignment 4C - Option C. It contains the updated version of the app: R Built-in Data Sets, which can be acessed with this *link*: https://dilan330.shinyapps.io/Assignment-B-4-Dilan330/
This app was built from code ini `App_4.R`. 

### Updated Features 
All new features are commented in the code as *NEW FEATURE*. This app still offers quick and accessible information about some of the built-in data sets in R. We have now included a note in the sidebar panel (*Feature 1*) which explains the relationship between the selected number of observations and the displays. This new feature was accompanied with an update to the main panel as well, with "Summary" and "Observations" headers. Next, we added an "Update Display" button (*Feature 2*) which allows user input to determine when the Observation Display should update its table. Finally, there is now an "Download" button (*Feature 3*) in the sidebar panel which allows users to download the selected data set onto a .csv file.
